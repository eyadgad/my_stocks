# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository (Manual)
1. Go to https://github.com/eyadgad
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right and select "New repository"
3. Repository name: `my_stocks`
4. Description: "Real-time stock portfolio tracker with live price updates"
5. Keep it **Public** (or Private if you prefer)
6. Do **NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
7. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Add Remote and Push
After creating the repository, run these commands:

```powershell
# Add the GitHub remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/eyadgad/my_stocks.git

# Verify the remote was added
git remote -v

# Push all commits to GitHub
git push -u origin master
```

## Alternative: Push Commits in Batches
If you want to push commits in smaller batches (not all at once), you can run the `push_commits.ps1` script that will be created.

## Current Status
